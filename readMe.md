This repo is dedicated to the topic of 'Downscaling LST using SAR images'. For the
downscaling algorithm two main models were considered: Random Forest and Convolution
Neural Network. Corresponding to this, there are two main scripts in this repo rf and cnn

In these scripts, there are lines of codes related to loading the data. To reproduce, this
data can be collected from the provided data collection script. The data collection script
facilitates collection of data from the Google Earth Engine database
